# Practicing Typescript: Generalized Algebraic Data Types

This repository contains the code referenced by the blog post ["Practicing Typescript: Generalized Algebraic Data Types"](https://www.matteopellegrino.dev/posts/typescript-algebraic-data-types).

It serves as a local playground for Typescript inference, it is not meant to be executed.
